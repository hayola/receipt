# Redux Shopping Cart Example
### With Added Functionality

This is a fork of the [redux shopping cart](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/shopping-cart) with the added functionality of:

* [reactabular](https://github.com/reactabular/reactabular)
* the ability to remove items from your cart prior to checking out
* previous checkout transactions via
* an overall receipt view
* a detailed receipt view.

This project template was built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), which provides a simple way to start React projects with no build configuration needed.

### To run locally

```
git clone git@github.com:stormasm/receipt.git
